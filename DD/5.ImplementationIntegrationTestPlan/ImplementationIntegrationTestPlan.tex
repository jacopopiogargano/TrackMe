	\section{Implementation Plan}
		The effort done in the design of the system to be, in particular in the identification of the core components, reflects as a significant simplification of the implementation phase. All shown components in fact have well defined interfaces between each other: this gives to the developing team more flexibility in choosing the sequence of the components implementation. Potentially all components could be implemented in parallel leaving to the integration phase - through the connection of all components - the responsability of enabling the fully operation of the system to be. \\ \\
		Considering a realistic scenario in which team size and costs constraints influence the planning of the activities, the following is an example of an implementation plan based on team skills.
		
		\image {13cm} {IIT_Diagrams/ImplementationPlan.jpg} {Dev skills based Implementation Plan} {ImplementationPlan}

		The diagram shows the implementation of all the modules of \ic{Data4Help}, \ic{AutomatedSOS}, \ic{Track4Run} using five parallel developing processes:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Database implementation - Database skills
	\item Data4Help Server implementation - Backend skills
	\item Websites needed by Data4Help, Track4Run, AutomatedSOS - Full stack web skills
	\item Data4Help Use app - Full stack app skills
	\item AutomatesSOS and Track4Run servers - Backend skills
\end{enumerate}
As previously written, the interfaces-enabled independece of all the components enable to eventually change this plan according to team size and costs constraints.

	\section{Integration Plan}
		The following list, divided by product, shows which integrations must be performed. To declare a product completed, all relative integrations must be performed. All services (included AutomatedSOS and Track4Run) depend on Data4Help so in these cases, in addiction to complete all integrations as stated before, another fundamental condition is that Data4Help is completed and fully working [*].\\ \\
		The integrations to be done are shown in a plain list because the order of integration is not important

		\paragraph{Data4Help Server}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item{Integration between Data4Help Server: Request manager and Data4Help Server: Data manager}
			\item{Integration between Data4Help Server: Notifications manager and Data4Help Server: Data4Help Database}
			\item{Integration between Data4Help Server: Services manager and Data4Help Server: Data manager}
			\item{Integration between Data4Help Server: Data manager and Data4Help Database}
			\item{Integration between Data4Help Server: Data receiver and Data4Help Server: Data manager}
			\item{Integration between Data4Help Server: Authentication and Data4Help Database}
		\end{itemize}

		\paragraph{Data4Help User Application}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item{Integration between Data4Help User Application: Authentication and Data4Help Server: Authentication}
			\item{Integration between Data4Help User Application: Data sender and Data4Help Server: Data receiver}
			\item{Integration between Data4Help User Application: Services manager and Data4Help Server: Notifications manager}
			\item{Integration between Data4Help User Application: Services manager and Data4Help Server: Services manager}
		\end{itemize}

		\paragraph{AutomatedSOS}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item{Integration between AutomatedSOS Server: Service interface provider (website) and AutomatedSOS Server: User monitor}
			\item{Integration between AutomatedSOS Server: Data analyzer and AutomatedSOS Server: Data receiver}
			\item{Integration between AutomatedSOS Server: User monitor and AutomatedSOS Database}
			\item{Integration between AutomatedSOS Server: User monitor and Local emergency services caller}
			\item{Integration between AutomatedSOS Server: Data receiver and AutomatedSOS Server: Data analyzer}
			\item{*Integration between AutomatedSOS Server: Data receiver and Data4Help}
		\end{itemize}

		\paragraph{Track4Run}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item{Integration between Track4Run Organizers website and Track4Run Server: Authentication}
			\item{Integration between Track4Run Organizers website and Track4Run Server: Run manager}
			\item{Integration between Track4Run Spectators website and Track4Run Server: Run manager}
			\item{Integration between Track4Run Server: Run manager and Track4Run Database}
			\item{Integration between Track4Run Server: Service interface provider (website) and Track4Run Server: Run manager}
			\item{Integration between Track4Run Server: Data receiver and Track4Run Server: Run manager}
			\item{Integration between Track4Run Server: Authentication and Track4Run Database}
			\item{*Integration between Track4Run Server: Data receiver and Data4Help}
		\end{itemize}

	\section{Testing Plan}
		\subsection{Unit Testing}
		It must be performed during the development of each component and finalized at the end of each of them. Due to this reason, the testing plan completally overlaps the implementation plan:

		\image {13cm} {IIT_Diagrams/UnitTesting.jpg} {Dev skills based Testing Plan} {TestingPlan}
		
		\paragraph{Recommendations}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Approach: It is recommended to follow a TDD - Test Driven Development \todo{Aggiungere reference a TDD Manifest: Test Driven Development: By Example (Anglais) Broché – 8 novembre 2002}
			\item Coverage: The recommended coverage is 100\% of methods and classes and 90\% of lines of code.
			\item Tools: In order to monitor effectively the coverage, it is recommended using some tools like SonarQube or JUnit. \todo{verificare quest'ultima parte di sonarqube e junit}.
		\end{itemize} 
		
		\subsection{Integration testing} Must be performed on each case listed in the previous section. To execute integration testing all the components to be integrated must be completed. The testing can be executed in parallel with respect to main implementation: this means that during the integration testing, the implementation of new components can go on.\\
